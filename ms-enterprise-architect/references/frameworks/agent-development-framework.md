# Agent Development Framework - Multi-Agent Systems and Orchestration

## Definition

The Agent Development Framework provides architectural patterns and best practices for designing, implementing, and orchestrating AI agents in enterprise environments. An agent is an autonomous AI system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the Microsoft ecosystem, agents leverage Azure OpenAI, Copilot Studio, Semantic Kernel, and other AI services to deliver intelligent automation and decision support.

Modern enterprise AI architectures increasingly rely on multi-agent systems—collections of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to handle. These systems mirror human organizational structures where specialists work together, each contributing their unique expertise while coordinating through well-defined communication protocols.

This framework addresses the unique challenges of building production-grade agent systems: orchestration patterns, state management, error handling, human oversight, security, and integration with existing enterprise systems across Microsoft platforms including Dynamics 365, Power Platform, Azure, and Microsoft 365.

## Core Agent Design Patterns

```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Sequential Workflow

Agents execute in a predefined sequence, with each agent's output becoming the next agent's input. This is the simplest orchestration pattern, suitable for linear processes.

**When to Use**:
- Clear, linear process flow
- Each step depends on previous step's completion
- Deterministic ordering is required

**Microsoft Implementation**: Azure Logic Apps with sequential actions, Durable Functions with function chaining.

**Example**: Document processing pipeline: Extract text → Classify content → Extract entities → Generate summary → Store results.

### 2. Parallel Execution

Multiple agents execute simultaneously, often processing different aspects of the same problem independently. Results are aggregated when all agents complete.

**When to Use**:
- Independent subtasks that can run concurrently
- Need to minimize total execution time
- Aggregating multiple perspectives or data sources

**Microsoft Implementation**: Azure Durable Functions fan-out/fan-in pattern, parallel branches in Logic Apps.

**Example**: Market research agent dispatches parallel agents to analyze competitors, customer sentiment, industry trends, and regulatory changes simultaneously.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Orchestrator] --> B[Agent 1: Competitor Analysis]
    A --> C[Agent 2: Sentiment Analysis]
    A --> D[Agent 3: Trend Analysis]
    A --> E[Agent 4: Regulatory Scan]
    B --> F[Aggregator]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Comprehensive Report]
    style A fill:#E81123,color:#fff
    style B fill:#0078D4,color:#fff
    style C fill:#0078D4,color:#fff
    style D fill:#0078D4,color:#fff
    style E fill:#0078D4,color:#fff
```

### 3. Conditional Routing

The orchestrator routes tasks to different agents based on conditions, classifications, or decision logic. Enables dynamic, adaptive workflows.

**When to Use**:
- Different scenarios require different handling
- Classification or triage is needed
- Resource optimization based on complexity

**Microsoft Implementation**: Copilot Studio conditional branching, Logic Apps switch/condition actions, Semantic Kernel with dynamic plugin selection.

**Example**: Customer inquiry router that directs technical questions to engineering agents, billing questions to finance agents, and general questions to a generalist agent.

### 4. Iterative Refinement

An agent produces an initial output, an evaluator assesses it, and based on feedback, the output is refined through multiple iterations until quality thresholds are met.

**When to Use**:
- Quality standards are critical
- Initial attempts may need improvement
- Feedback-driven improvement is possible

**Microsoft Implementation**: Azure Durable Functions with eternal orchestrations, Power Automate approval loops.

**Example**: Content generation agent creates marketing copy, evaluator checks brand compliance and persuasiveness, iterates until both metrics exceed thresholds or max iterations reached.

### 5. Competitive Execution

Multiple agents attempt the same task using different approaches or models. The best result (based on evaluation criteria) is selected.

**When to Use**:
- Uncertainty about optimal approach
- Quality is paramount
- Computational resources allow redundancy

**Microsoft Implementation**: Multiple Azure OpenAI deployments with different models/prompts, A/B testing with Application Insights.

**Example**: Code generation task executed by GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini agents simultaneously, with automated testing selecting the version that passes most test cases.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task] --> B[Agent 1: Approach A]
    A --> C[Agent 2: Approach B]
    A --> D[Agent 3: Approach C]
    B --> E[Evaluator]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F{Select Best}
    F --> G[Winning Solution]
    style E fill:#107C10,color:#fff
```

### 6. Hierarchical Delegation

A high-level agent delegates subtasks to specialized sub-agents, which may further delegate to their own sub-agents, creating a tree structure.

**When to Use**:
- Complex problems with natural hierarchical decomposition
- Different levels of abstraction are needed
- Specialist agents exist for specific domains

**Microsoft Implementation**: Nested Durable Functions orchestrations, Copilot Studio with multiple nested topics.

**Example**: Executive assistant agent delegates to calendar agent (which coordinates with meeting scheduler and attendee availability agents), travel agent (which coordinates with booking and expense agents), and communications agent.
