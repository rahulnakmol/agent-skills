- **Examples**: Formatting inconsistency, minor technical inaccuracy, missing non-critical documentation
- **SLA**: Remediate within 1 week
- **Escalation**: Track in backlog, address before phase gate

### Low (P4)
- **Impact**: Minor issue, cosmetic or enhancement
- **Examples**: Typos, style guide deviations, suggestions for improvement
- **SLA**: Remediate as capacity allows
- **Escalation**: Track in backlog, address opportunistically

## Remediation Workflows

### Defect Remediation Process

1. **Detection**: Reviewer identifies defect during quality review
2. **Classification**: Assign severity (P1-P4) and category
3. **Assignment**: Route to responsible team member
4. **Remediation**: Fix defect and update documentation
5. **Verification**: Reviewer validates fix
6. **Closure**: Mark defect as resolved in tracking system

### Review Feedback Loop

**Review Cycle**
1. Author submits deliverable for review
2. Reviewer conducts assessment within 2 business days
3. Feedback provided with specific, actionable comments
4. Author remediates issues
5. Revised deliverable re-submitted
6. Reviewer verifies remediation
7. Deliverable approved or cycle repeats (maximum 3 iterations)

**Escalation Path**
- Iteration 3+: Escalate to technical lead for guidance
- Repeated quality issues: Additional training or support
- Systemic problems: Process improvement review

## Continuous Improvement Processes

### Lessons Learned Capture

**Post-Engagement Retrospective**
- Conduct within 2 weeks of engagement completion
- Include all team members
- Structured format: What went well, what didn't, what to change
- Document in lessons learned repository
- Share insights with broader team

**Continuous Improvement Actions**
- Identify top 3 improvement opportunities
- Assign owners and target completion dates
- Track progress in monthly quality reviews
- Update standards and templates based on learnings
- Celebrate improvements and share successes

### Quality Metrics Tracking

**Key Quality Indicators**
- Defect density (defects per deliverable)
- Rework rate (percentage requiring revision)
- Review cycle time (time from submission to approval)
- Customer satisfaction scores
- On-time delivery percentage

**Monthly Quality Dashboard**
- Track trends over time
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Recognize high-quality work
- Address systemic issues
- Report to leadership

## Conclusion

These quality standards ensure that all enterprise architecture deliverables meet the high bar expected by clients and stakeholders. Consistent application of these standards, combined with continuous improvement based on feedback and lessons learned, drives excellence in enterprise architecture practice. All architects must internalize these standards and apply them rigorously to every engagement.
