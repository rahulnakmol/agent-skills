## Licensing Considerations

### Licensing Model Overview

Understanding licensing is crucial for platform selection and solution design:

| Platform | Primary Licensing Model | Key Considerations |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Microsoft 365 | Per-user subscription (E3, E5, Business) | Includes baseline services; premium features require E5 |
| Power Platform | Per-user or per-app | Premium connectors, AI Builder require additional licensing |
| Azure | Consumption-based (pay-as-you-go) | Predictable costs require careful architecture planning |
| Dynamics 365 | Per-user subscription by application | Can be costly; consider user types (full vs. team member) |
| Azure AI | Consumption-based | OpenAI has specific pricing models (tokens); can add significant cost |
| Microsoft Entra | Included in M365; premium features extra | P1/P2 required for advanced features |

### Cost Optimization Patterns

**Pattern**: Use appropriate user licensing tiers
- Full users for power users
- Team member licenses for limited access
- External user scenarios via Entra B2B

**Pattern**: Leverage included capabilities
- Power Platform included with many M365 licenses (with limits)
- Azure AD P1 included with many E3+ licenses
- Basic Dataverse included with Power Apps licenses

**Pattern**: Hybrid platform approaches
- Use Power Platform for internal users (per-user license)
- Use Azure for external-facing solutions (consumption-based)
- Leverage M365 for data storage (included with licenses)

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Using Azure for Simple Business Apps
**Problem**: Building custom code solutions when low-code would suffice

**Impact**:
- Higher development costs and timelines
- Increased maintenance burden
- Reduced business agility

**Solution**: Evaluate Power Platform first for departmental apps; use Azure for complex, mission-critical solutions

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Over-Extending Low-Code Platforms
**Problem**: Forcing complex requirements into Power Platform

**Impact**:
- Performance issues
- Maintainability challenges
- Technical debt accumulation

**Solution**: Recognize when requirements exceed low-code capabilities; use Azure for complex business logic and integration

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring Data Platform Integration
**Problem**: Creating data silos by not leveraging Dataverse or Azure integration

**Impact**:
- Duplicate data across platforms
- Synchronization complexity
- Inconsistent data quality

**Solution**: Use Dataverse as the common data platform for business applications; Azure SQL/Cosmos for specialized needs

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Platform Islands
**Problem**: Implementing platforms in isolation without integration strategy

**Impact**:
- Missed productivity opportunities
- Poor user experience
- Redundant capabilities

**Solution**: Design for cross-platform integration from the start; leverage Microsoft Graph, connectors, and APIs

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Wrong Platform for AI Solutions
**Problem**: Building custom AI/ML from scratch when pre-built services exist

**Impact**:
- Reinventing the wheel
- Higher complexity and cost
- Delayed time to value

**Solution**: Leverage Azure AI services first; build custom models only when necessary

## Platform Evolution and Trends

### Current Trends (2024-2025)

**AI Integration Everywhere**:
- Copilots embedded in every platform
- Generative AI capabilities becoming standard
- AI-assisted development and operations

**Platform Convergence**:
- Deeper integration between platforms
- Unified developer experiences
- Common data models (Microsoft Cloud for Industry)

**Low-Code Expansion**:
- Power Platform capabilities expanding
- Professional developer tools improving
- Fusion development models emerging

**Sovereign Cloud and Compliance**:
- Regional data residency options
- Industry-specific clouds
- Enhanced compliance capabilities
