# Dynamics 365 - Business Applications Platform Architecture

## Overview

Dynamics 365 is Microsoft's suite of intelligent business applications for customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP). For enterprise architects, Dynamics 365 represents a strategic platform for core business processes, combining pre-built business applications with extensibility through Power Platform and integration with the broader Microsoft ecosystem.

## Platform Positioning

**Strategic Role**: Dynamics 365 provides packaged business applications for:
- **Customer Engagement**: Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Field Service
- **Operations**: Finance, Supply Chain Management, Commerce, Human Resources
- **Customer Data**: Customer Insights for unified customer data platform
- **Industry Solutions**: Pre-built solutions for healthcare, manufacturing, retail, financial services

**Architectural Philosophy**: "Configure first, customize when needed"—leverage out-of-box capabilities, extend with Power Platform, develop custom code only when necessary.

## Core Applications Overview

### Customer Engagement Applications

These applications run on Dataverse and focus on customer-facing processes:

## Dataverse as the Foundation

### Why Dataverse Matters for Dynamics 365

Customer Engagement apps (Sales, Service, Marketing, Field Service) run on **Dataverse**:
- **Common data model**: Shared schema across apps
- **Business logic**: Shared business rules, workflows, plugins
- **Security**: Unified security model
- **Extensibility**: Power Platform native integration
- **APIs**: Single Web API for all apps

---

## Extensibility and Customization

### Extension Hierarchy (Preferred Approaches)

1. **Configuration** (No-code): Use out-of-box configuration
   - Custom fields, views, forms
   - Business rules
   - Business process flows

2. **Low-Code Extensions** (Power Platform):
   - Power Automate for workflows
   - Power Apps for custom screens
   - Power BI for analytics
   - Copilot Studio for chatbots

3. **Pro-Code Extensions** (Custom development):
   - Plugins (server-side code)
   - Custom APIs
   - Client-side scripts (JavaScript)
   - PCF controls (Power Apps Component Framework)

4. **Integration** (External systems):
   - Custom connectors
   - Azure Functions
   - Azure Logic Apps
   - API Management

**Best Practice**: Start at the top of the hierarchy and move down only when necessary.

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Over-Customization

**Problem**: Excessive custom code making upgrades difficult

**Impact**: Technical debt, upgrade blockers, supportability issues

**Solution**: Leverage configuration and Power Platform; use custom code sparingly

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Ignoring Data Model

**Problem**: Creating flat custom tables without relationships

**Impact**: Data integrity issues, reporting challenges, poor performance

**Solution**: Follow common data model, use relationships, normalize appropriately

### Anti-Pattern 3: Poor Integration Design

**Problem**: Synchronous, real-time integration causing performance issues

**Impact**: Slow user experience, timeout errors, data inconsistency

**Solution**: Use asynchronous patterns, queuing, dual-write only when needed
