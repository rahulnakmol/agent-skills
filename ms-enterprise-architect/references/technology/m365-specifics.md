# Microsoft 365 Platform - Architecture and Integration Patterns

## Overview

Microsoft 365 (M365) is Microsoft's comprehensive productivity and collaboration platform, combining Office applications, cloud services, device management, and security into an integrated solution. For enterprise architects, M365 serves as the foundational productivity layer and data platform for many enterprise solutions.

## Platform Positioning

**Strategic Role**: Microsoft 365 is the productivity foundation of the modern workplace, providing:
- User productivity tools (Office apps)
- Collaboration and communication (Teams, SharePoint, Exchange)
- Content management and compliance (SharePoint, OneDrive, Purview)
- Identity and security foundation (Microsoft Entra ID)
- Extensibility platform for custom solutions

**Architectural Significance**: M365 is not just an application suite—it's a platform with rich APIs (Microsoft Graph), extensibility points, and integration capabilities that make it central to enterprise architecture.

## Core Services Deep Dive

### 1. Microsoft Teams

**Purpose**: Hub for teamwork combining chat, meetings, calling, and collaboration

**Architecture Capabilities**:
- **Channel-based collaboration** with persistent chat history
- **Integrated meetings** with recording and transcription
- **App extensibility** via tabs, bots, messaging extensions, and meeting apps
- **Teams Toolkit** for developer productivity
- **Graph API integration** for programmatic access

**Common Architecture Patterns**:

        API[Custom API<br/>Azure/On-Prem]
        SPO[SharePoint<br/>Document Library]
        Dataverse[(Dataverse)]
    end

    Tab -->|REST API| API
    Bot -->|Bot Framework| API
    MsgExt -->|Search/Action| API

    Tab -->|SharePoint Framework| SPO
    Tab -->|Power Apps| Dataverse

    classDef backend fill:#0078d4,stroke:#004578,color:#fff

    class Tab,Bot,MsgExt teams
    class API,SPO,Dataverse backend
```

**Integration Points**:
- Power Apps embedded as tabs
- Power BI reports and dashboards
- SharePoint pages and document libraries
- Custom Line-of-Business (LOB) applications
- Third-party SaaS via connectors

**Licensing Considerations**:
- Basic Teams capabilities included in all M365 licenses
- Advanced features (webinars, advanced calling) require specific licenses
- Developer tools free with M365 subscription

### 2. SharePoint Online

**Purpose**: Enterprise content management, intranet, and collaboration platform

**Architecture Capabilities**:
- **Document libraries** with versioning, check-in/out, metadata
- **Lists** as structured data stores (relational-like)
- **Sites and hubs** for information architecture
- **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** for custom development
- **Content types and managed metadata** for taxonomy
- **Search** with customization and refinement
- **Workflow integration** with Power Automate

**Common Architecture Patterns**:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Hub["Hub Site - Enterprise Portal"]
        Home[Home Site<br/>Company Intranet]
    end

    subgraph Associated["Associated Sites"]
        HR[HR Site<br/>Policies & Forms]
        IT[IT Site<br/>Knowledge Base]
        Dept[Department Sites]
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Architecture"]
        ContentTypes[Content Types<br/>Metadata Schema]
        TermStore[Managed Metadata<br/>Term Store]
        Search[Enterprise Search<br/>Indexed Content]
    end

    Home --> HR
    Home --> IT
    Home --> Dept

    HR -.->|Apply| ContentTypes
    IT -.->|Apply| ContentTypes
    Dept -.->|Apply| ContentTypes

    ContentTypes --> TermStore
    HR --> Search
    IT --> Search
    Dept --> Search

    classDef hub fill:#0078d4,stroke:#004578,color:#fff
    classDef site fill:#00bcf2,stroke:#0078d4,color:#000
    classDef data fill:#fff100,stroke:#ffb900,color:#000

    class Home hub
    class HR,IT,Dept site
    class ContentTypes,TermStore,Search data
```

**Data Storage Patterns**:
- **Document-centric**: Primary use case, with Office integration
- **Structured lists**: Lightweight relational data (use Dataverse for complex scenarios)
- **Hybrid**: Document libraries with rich metadata from lists

**Integration Points**:
- **Microsoft Graph**: Programmatic access to sites, lists, and documents
- **Power Platform**: SharePoint lists as data sources for Power Apps/Automate
- **Teams**: SharePoint provides backend storage for Teams files
- **Azure**: Event-driven integration via webhooks and Azure functions
- **Search**: Microsoft Search aggregates SharePoint, OneDrive, and other M365 content

**Licensing Considerations**:
- SharePoint Online included in all M365 business and enterprise licenses
- Storage quotas: 1TB base + 10GB per licensed user + additional storage available
- Advanced features (advanced data loss prevention) require E5

---

### 3. Exchange Online

**Purpose**: Enterprise email, calendaring, and contact management

**Architecture Capabilities**:
- **Mailbox services** with archiving and compliance
- **Calendaring** with scheduling assistance and room booking
- **Mail flow rules** for routing and compliance
- **Journaling and retention** for regulatory compliance

    participant Exchange as Exchange Online
    participant PowerAutomate as Power Automate
    participant System as Line-of-Business System

    User->>Exchange: Send email to shared mailbox
    Exchange->>PowerAutomate: Email arrives (trigger)
    PowerAutomate->>PowerAutomate: Parse email content
    PowerAutomate->>PowerAutomate: Extract attachments
    PowerAutomate->>System: Create record via API
    PowerAutomate->>Exchange: Send confirmation email
    Exchange->>User: Confirmation received
```

**Integration Points**:

- Building custom email infrastructure (leverage built-in capabilities)
- Ignoring mail flow security (implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

**Licensing Considerations**:
- Exchange Online Plan 1: 50GB mailbox
- Exchange Online Plan 2 or M365 E3/E5: 100GB mailbox + in-place archive
- Shared mailboxes: Free (no license required, up to 50GB)

- **Consistent patterns**: REST API with OData query capabilities
- **Webhooks**: Subscribe to change notifications
- **Batch requests**: Combine multiple requests for efficiency

**Common Integration Pattern**:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Apps["Applications"]
        CustomApp[Custom Application]
        PowerApp[Power Apps]
        LogicApp[Azure Logic Apps]
    end

    Graph[Microsoft Graph API<br/>graph.microsoft.com]

    subgraph M365["Microsoft 365 Data"]
        Users[Users & Groups<br/>Entra ID]
        Mail[Email & Calendar<br/>Exchange]
        Files[Files & Folders<br/>OneDrive/SharePoint]
        Teams[Teams & Channels]
        Analytics[Analytics<br/>Viva Insights]
    end

    CustomApp -->|REST API| Graph

    LogicApp -->|Built-in Connector| Graph

    Graph --> Users
    Graph --> Mail
    Graph --> Files
    Graph --> Teams
    Graph --> Analytics

    classDef graph fill:#f25022,stroke:#c03a1a,color:#fff
    classDef data fill:#7fba00,stroke:#5e8c00,color:#fff

    class CustomApp,PowerApp,LogicApp app
    class Graph graph
    class Users,Mail,Files,Teams,Analytics data
```

**Authentication**:
- Delegated permissions: User context (interactive apps)
- Application permissions: App-only context (daemon services)
- Conditional Access policies apply to Graph API calls

---

### SharePoint Lists vs. Dataverse: When to Use Each

| Criteria | SharePoint Lists | Dataverse |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Best For** | Simple data, document-centric | Complex business data, relational |
| **Relationships** | Lookup columns (simple) | Complex relationships, foreign keys |
| **Business Logic** | Power Automate, SPFx | Business rules, plugins, workflows |
| **Security** | Item-level permissions (limited) | Field-level security, row-level security |
| **Licensing** | Included in M365 | Power Apps/Dynamics 365 required |
| **Storage** | Part of SharePoint quota | Separate database capacity |
| **Offline** | Limited | Full offline capabilities |
| **Performance** | Good for <5000 items per view | Optimized for millions of records |

**Decision Guidance**:
- Start with SharePoint lists for simple scenarios
- Migrate to Dataverse when you need complex business logic, relationships, or offline capabilities
- Use hybrid approach: Documents in SharePoint, structured data in Dataverse
