# Proposal Templates

## Overview

Enterprise architects create proposals for new engagements, respond to RFPs, and develop Statements of Work. This guide provides templates for winning proposals that demonstrate Microsoft ecosystem expertise while aligning with client needs.

**Skills-First Reminder**: Before creating ANY proposal document, ALWAYS check for available skills:
- **docx skill** → Proposals, SOWs, RFP responses, detailed narratives
- **pptx skill** → Proposal presentations, executive summaries, capability overviews
- **xlsx skill** → Pricing models, resource plans, project schedules, cost breakdowns
- **pdf skill** → Final proposal packages for client delivery

## Statement of Work (SOW) Template

### When to Use
Use SOW templates to formalize engagement scope, deliverables, and terms with clients. Required for:
- New project engagements
- Phase/milestone approvals
- Contract amendments
- Partner/vendor agreements

## Best Practices for Proposals & RFPs

### 1. Skills-First Approach
- Always check for **docx skill** before creating proposals
- Use **xlsx skill** for pricing models and schedules
- Use **pptx skill** for proposal presentations
- Use **pdf skill** for final client-ready delivery

### 2. Client-Centric Language
- Use client's terminology and business language
- Focus on their outcomes, not your process
- Quantify benefits wherever possible
- Address their pain points directly

### 3. Differentiation
- Don't just match requirements - exceed them
- Highlight unique approaches and IP
- Demonstrate thought leadership
- Show understanding beyond what's written

### 4. Evidence-Based Claims
- Every claim supported by evidence (case study, metric, certification)
- Quantify experience (years, project count, certifications)
- Name specific Microsoft technologies and patterns
- Reference framework adherence (WAF, CAF, etc.)

### 5. Visual Communication
- Use diagrams from **mermaid-diagram-patterns.md**
- Include architecture visuals
- Charts for pricing and timeline (use **xlsx skill**)
- Screenshots or mockups when helpful

### 6. Compliance & Completeness
- Respond to every RFP requirement explicitly
- Use RFP's structure and numbering
- Include all requested attachments
- Follow submission guidelines precisely

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Generic boilerplate**: Customize for each client/opportunity
2. **Technology-first**: Lead with business outcomes, not tech features
3. **Underselling**: Highlight credentials and experience confidently
4. **Vague pricing**: Be specific and transparent about costs
5. **Missing skills check**: Always verify available document creation skills
6. **No visual elements**: Include diagrams, charts, and tables
7. **Overpromising**: Set realistic expectations and build in buffer
8. **Forgetting the "so what"**: Always connect features to business value
